# VSCode Neovim Settings & Keymaps

This repository contains my personal VSCode settings and keybindings for integrating Neovim with VSCode using the `vscode-neovim` extension, along with `which-key` for enhanced keybinding hints.

## Extensions
To fully utilize this setup, install the following extensions:

- [VSCode Neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) - Enables Neovim as the backend for VSCode.
- [VSpaceCode - Which Key](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/vscode-which-key) - Provides a popup displaying available keybindings.

## Features
- Seamless Neovim integration within VSCode
- Improved modal editing experience
- Keybinding suggestions with `which-key`
- Custom key mappings for efficient navigation and editing

## Installation
1. Install [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and ensure it is available in your system's PATH.
2. Install VSCode and the required extensions listed above.
3. Clone this repository and apply the settings and keybindings to your VSCode configuration.

## Neovim Config
This setup also make use of your default neovim configuration for those who use neovim as the terminal text editor as well. Although, my neovim specific keybinds and settings don't seems to work, you can still look into my neovim config.
